# Package Manager Version Pinning

* Proposal: SE-XXXX
* Author: [Daniel Dunbar](https://github.com/ddunbar), [Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: Discussion

## Introduction

This is a proposal for adding package manager features to "pin" or "lock" package dependencies to particular versions.

## Motivation

As used in this proposal, version pinning refers to the practice of controlling
*exactly* which specific version of a dependency is selected by the dependency
resolution algorithm, *independent from* the semantic versioning
specification. Thus, it is a way of instructing the package manager to select a
particular version from among all of the versions of a package which could be
chosen while honoring the dependency constraints.

### Terminology

*We have chosen to use "pinning" to refer to this feature, over "lockfiles", since
the term "lock" is already overloaded between POSIX file locks and locks in
concurrent programming.*

### Philosophy

Our philosophy with regard to pinning is that we actively want to encourage
packages to develop against the latest semantically appropriate versions of
their dependencies, in order to foster rapid development amongst the ecosystem
and strong reliance on the semantic versioning concept. Our design for version
pinning is thus intended to be a feature for package authors and users to use in
crafting *specific* workflows, not be a mechanism by which most of the packages
in the ecosystem pin themselves to specific versions of each other.

### Use Cases

Our proposal is designed to satisfy several different use cases for such a behavior:

1. Standardizing team workflows

	When collaborating on a package, it can be valuable for team members (and
continuous integration) to all know they are using the same exact version of
dependencies, to avoid "works for me" situations.

	This can be particularly important for certain kinds of open source projects
which are actively being cloned by new users, and which want to have some
measure of control around exactly which available version of a dependency is
selected.

2. Difficult to test packages or dependencies

	Complex packages which have dependencies which may be hard to test, or hard to
analyze when they break, may choose to maintain careful control over what
versions of their upstream dependencies they recommend -- even if conceptually
they regularly update those recommendations following the true semantic version
specification of the dependency.

3. Dependency locking w.r.t. deployment

	When stabilizing a release for deployment, or building a version of a package
for deployment, it is important to be able to lock down the exact versions of
dependencies in use, so that the resulting product can be exactly recreated
later if necessary.

## Proposed solution

We will introduce support for an **optional** new file `Package.pins` adjacent
to the `Package.swift` manifest, called the "pins file". We will also introduce
a number of new commands (see below) for maintaining the pins file.

This file will record the active version pin information for the package,
including data such as the package identifier, the pinned version, and explicit
information on the pinned version (e.g., the commit hash/SHA for the resolved
tag).

The exact file format is unspecified/implementation defined, however, in
practice it will be a JSON data file.

This file *may* be checked into SCM by the user, so that its effects apply to
all users of the package. However, it may also be maintained only locally (e.g.,
placed in the `.gitignore` file). We intend to leave it to package authors to
decide which use case is best for their project.

In the presence of a `Package.pins` file, the package manager will respect the
pinned dependencies recorded in the file whenever it needs to do dependency
resolution (e.g., on the initial checkout or when updating).

The pins file will not override Manifest specified version requirements and it
will be an error (with proper diagnostics) if there is a conflict between the pins
and the manifest specification.

## Detailed Design

1. We will add a new command `pin` to `swift package` tool with following semantics:

	```
	$ swift package pin ( [--all] | [<package-name>] [<version>] ) [--message <message>]
	```
    
	The `package-name` refers to the name of the package as specified in its manifest.

	This command pins one or all dependencies. The command which pins a single version can optionally take a specific version to pin to, if unspecified (or with --all) the behaviour is to pin to the current package version in use. Examples:  
	* `$ swift package pin --all` - pins all the dependencies.
	* `$ swift package pin Foo` - pins `Foo` at current resolved version.
	* `$ swift package pin Foo 1.2.3` - pins `Foo` at 1.2.3. The specified version should be valid and resolvable.

 The `--reason` option is an optional argument to document the reason for pinning a dependency. This could be helpful for user to later remember why a dependency was pinned. Example:   
 
	```
	$ swift package pin Foo --reason "The patch updates for Foo are really unstable and need screening."
	```


2. Dependencies are never automatically pinned, pinning is only ever taken as a result of an explicit user action.
 
3. We will add a new command `unpin`:

	```
	$ swift package unpin ( [--all] | [<package-name>] )
	``` 
	This is the counterpart to the pin command, and unpins one or all packages.

4. We will fetch and resolve the dependencies when running the pin commands, in case we don't have the complete dependency graph yet.

5. We will extend the workflow for update to honour version pinning, that is, it will only update packages which are unpinned, and it will only update to versions which can satisfy the existing pins. The update command will, however, also take an optional argument `--repin`:

	```
	$ swift package update [--repin]
	```

	* Update command errors if there are no unpinned packages which can be updated.

	* Otherwise, the behaviour is to update all unpinned packages to the latest possible versions which can be resolved while respecting the existing pins.

	* The `[--repin]` argument can be used to lift the version pinning restrictions. In this case, the behaviour is that all packages are updated, and packages which were previously pinned are then repinned to the latest resolved versions.

6. The update and checkout will both emit logs, notifying the user that pinning is in effect.

7. The `swift package show-dependencies` subcommand will be updated to indicate if a dependency is pinned.

8. As a future extension, we anticipate using the SHA information recorded in a pins file as a security feature, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on parts of the package graph.

## Impact on existing code

There will be change in the behaviours of `swift build` and `swift package update` in presence of the pins file, as noted in the proposal however the existing package will continue to build without any modifications.

## Alternative considered

We considered making the pinning behavior default on running `swift build`, however we think that pinning by default is likely to make the package graph more constrained than it should be. It drives the user away from taking full advantage of semantic versioning. We think it will be good for the package ecosystem if such a restriction is not the default behavior and that this design will lead to faster discovery of bugs and fixes in the upstream.
